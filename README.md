## Project Overview

This project is a console-based **eCommerce platform** created for our semester-long course project. The goal is to simulate a shopping experience, allowing users to manage both an inventory of products and their own shopping cart through a menu-driven interface.

The system implements full **CRUD operations** for both the inventory and the shopping cart, while enforcing inventory rules and providing a final receipt with tax upon checkout.
